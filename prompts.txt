I want to build a modular ERP for managing my YouTube channel and SaaS development team.

Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

Modules:
1. Team & HR Management
2. Project & Task Management
3. Finance & Budgeting
4. Analytics & Reporting
5. Content & Course Ops
6. User Roles & Permissions
7. Integrations (YouTube, Slack, Stripe, Notion)
8. Bonus: AI Assistant using GPT-4, Calendar Sync, OKR

Create folder structure for frontend and backend. Start by building User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control. Then guide me module by module.

Use REST API and JWT-based login. UI can be minimal for now.
